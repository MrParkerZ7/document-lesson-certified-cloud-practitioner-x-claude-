## Introduction

When running databases on AWS, you have two main options: self-managing databases on EC2 instances or using AWS-managed database services like RDS. Understanding the trade-offs between these approaches is important for the Cloud Practitioner exam.

## 🎯 Exam Tips

- **EC2-hosted** = full control, full responsibility (OS, patching, backups)
- **AWS-managed (RDS)** = AWS handles operations (patching, backups, HA)
- Choose **EC2-hosted** when you need unsupported engines or full OS access
- Choose **RDS/Aurora** to reduce operational burden and focus on your app
- **RDS** handles: hardware, OS patching, DB patching, backups, HA, scaling
- **Customer** handles (both options): schema design, query optimization, data
- AWS-managed services follow the **shared responsibility model**
- Consider **total cost of ownership**, not just instance pricing

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. EC2-hosted databases give you full control but require full management
