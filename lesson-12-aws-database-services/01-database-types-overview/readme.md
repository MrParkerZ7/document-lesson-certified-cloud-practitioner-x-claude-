## Introduction

Understanding database types is fundamental to choosing the right AWS database service for your application. AWS offers purpose-built databases for different workloads, and the Cloud Practitioner exam expects you to understand when to use relational vs NoSQL databases, and OLTP vs OLAP systems.

## Relational vs NoSQL Databases

| Aspect | Relational | NoSQL |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Schema | Fixed, predefined | Flexible, dynamic |
| Data Model | Tables with rows and columns | Key-value, document, graph, wide-column |
| Query Language | SQL | Varies by database type |
| Scalability | Vertical (scale up) | Horizontal (scale out) |
| Transactions | Strong ACID compliance | Eventual consistency (usually) |
| Use Cases | Financial systems, ERP, CRM | Web apps, gaming, IoT, real-time |
| AWS Services | RDS, Aurora | DynamoDB, DocumentDB |

## OLTP vs OLAP

Understanding the difference between transactional and analytical workloads is critical for database selection.

### OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Purpose | Handle day-to-day transactions |
| Query Type | Simple, short queries |
| Data Volume | Many small transactions |
| Operations | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE |
| Example | E-commerce orders, banking transactions |
| AWS Services | RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB |

### OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Purpose | Analyze historical data |
| Query Type | Complex, aggregation queries |
| Data Volume | Large datasets, batch processing |
| Operations | SELECT with GROUP BY, JOINs |
| Example | Business reporting, data mining |
| AWS Services | Redshift, Athena |

### OLTP vs OLAP Comparison

|   OLTP (Transactional)              OLAP (Analytical)             |
|   +----------------------+          +----------------------+      |
|   |  "Write" Focused     |          |  "Read" Focused      |      |
|   |                      |          |                      |      |
|   |  INSERT INTO orders  |          |  SELECT SUM(sales)   |      |
|   |  VALUES (...)        |          |  FROM orders         |      |
|   |                      |          |  GROUP BY region     |      |
|   |  Fast, small queries |          |  Complex queries     |      |

|   +----------------------+          +----------------------+      |
|                                                                   |
|   AWS: RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB        AWS: Redshift, Athena         |
|                                                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## When to Use Each Database Type

### Use Relational Databases (RDS/Aurora) When:

- Data has clear relationships between tables
- You need ACID transactions (banking, inventory)
- Complex queries with multiple JOINs required
- Data integrity is critical
- Working with structured, consistent data

### Use NoSQL Databases (DynamoDB) When:

- Schema may change frequently
- Need massive horizontal scalability
- Working with semi-structured data (JSON)
- Require single-digit millisecond latency
- Building real-time applications

### Use In-Memory Databases (ElastiCache) When:

- Need sub-millisecond response times
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Managing session data
- Gaming leaderboards

### Use Purpose-Built Databases When:

| Database | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| Neptune | Working with highly connected data (social networks, fraud detection) |
| DocumentDB | Need MongoDB compatibility |
| Timestream | Storing time-series data (IoT, DevOps metrics) |
| QLDB | Need immutable, cryptographically verifiable ledger |
| Keyspaces | Need Apache Cassandra compatibility |
