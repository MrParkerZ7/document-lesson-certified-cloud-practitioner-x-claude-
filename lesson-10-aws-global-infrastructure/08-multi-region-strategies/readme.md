## Multi-Region Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Active-Passive | Primary region active, secondary standby | Disaster recovery |
| Active-Active | Multiple regions serve traffic | High availability |
| Pilot Light | Minimal resources in standby | Cost-effective DR |
| Warm Standby | Scaled-down copy running | Faster recovery |
| Multi-Site | Full deployment in each region | Maximum availability |

## 🎯 Exam Tips

- **Active-Passive** = one region active, one standby
- **Active-Active** = multiple regions serving traffic
- **RTO** = how long can you be down
- **RPO** = how much data can you lose
- **Route 53** enables multi-region routing (failover, latency, geolocation)
- **S3 CRR** = Cross-Region Replication
- **Aurora Global** = low-latency global database
- **DynamoDB Global Tables** = multi-region, multi-active
- **Global Accelerator** = static IPs with optimized routing

## 🔑 Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Multi-Region | Deployment across AWS regions |
