## Exam Tips

- **CloudTrail** = records API calls (who did what, when)
- **Config** = tracks resource configurations and compliance
- **CloudTrail** stores 90 days free; use trails for longer storage
- **Config Rules** evaluate if resources are compliant
- **Audit Manager** generates compliance reports for auditors
- **SCPs** in Organizations restrict what accounts can do
- Know that CloudTrail and Config are different:
  - CloudTrail = activity (API calls)
  - Config = state (configuration)

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CloudTrail | API activity logging service |
| Trail | Long-term CloudTrail storage configuration |
| AWS Config | Resource configuration tracking service |
| Config Rule | Compliance evaluation for resources |
| Audit Manager | Compliance audit automation service |
| SCP | Service Control Policy (Organizations) |
| Conformance Pack | Collection of Config rules |

## Key Takeaways

1. CloudTrail records all API calls and can store logs in S3
2. AWS Config tracks resource configurations and evaluates compliance
3. Config Rules check if resources meet compliance requirements
4. Audit Manager automates compliance evidence collection and reporting
5. Organizations SCPs provide preventive guardrails across accounts
6. CloudTrail = activity logging; Config = configuration tracking
