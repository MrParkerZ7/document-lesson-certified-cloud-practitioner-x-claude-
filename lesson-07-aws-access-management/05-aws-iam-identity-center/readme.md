## Introduction

AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On or AWS SSO) is the recommended service for managing workforce access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. It provides a single place to create or connect workforce identities and manage their access centrally.

## What is IAM Identity Center?

IAM Identity Center enables you to manage access to all your AWS accounts and cloud applications from a single location. Users sign in once and can access all their assigned accounts and applications without re-entering credentials.

## Identity Sources

IAM Identity Center can use different identity sources:

| Source | Description | Best For |

## Permission Sets

Permission sets define what users can do in AWS accounts.

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Permission Set | Collection of policies assigned to users |
| AWS Managed | Pre-built by AWS (e.g., AdministratorAccess) |
| Custom | Policies you create |
| Session duration | How long credentials are valid |

### How Permission Sets Work

```
User/Group + Permission Set + AWS Account = Access
```

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| User | John Smith |
| Permission Set | DeveloperAccess |
| Account | Development Account |
| Result | John has developer permissions in dev account |

## User Portal

IAM Identity Center provides a user portal where users can:

- See all assigned AWS accounts
- Launch console sessions
- Access business applications
- View available roles
- Get CLI credentials

## Integration with AWS Organizations

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Automatic account discovery | See all accounts in organization |
| Delegated administration | Assign admin to member accounts |
| Centralized management | Manage from management account |
| Consistent permissions | Apply same permission sets across accounts |

## Setting Up IAM Identity Center

### Step 1: Enable IAM Identity Center

```
1. Go to IAM Identity Center in AWS Console
2. Choose your identity source
3. Enable in your organization
```

### Step 2: Create Users or Connect IdP

| Option | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| Built-in directory | Create users and groups directly |
| Active Directory | Connect to your AD |
| External IdP | Configure SAML connection |

### Step 3: Create Permission Sets

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| AWS Managed | AdministratorAccess, ViewOnlyAccess |
| Custom | Create with specific permissions |

### Step 4: Assign Access

```
Select User/Group -> Select Account(s) -> Select Permission Set(s)
```

## Benefits Over Traditional IAM

| Traditional IAM | IAM Identity Center |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Separate users per account | Single user, multiple accounts |
| Individual passwords | Single sign-on |
| Manual access management | Centralized management |
| No built-in SSO | Built-in SSO portal |
| Complex cross-account | Simple multi-account access |
