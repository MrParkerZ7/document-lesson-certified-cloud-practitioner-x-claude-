## Introduction

AWS offers multiple purchasing options for compute services, primarily EC2. Understanding these options is essential for optimizing costs while meeting your workload requirements. Each purchasing option offers different levels of flexibility, commitment, and savings.

## Overview of EC2 Purchasing Options

## 🎯 Exam Tips

- **On-Demand** = No commitment, pay-as-you-go, most flexible but no discount
- **Reserved Instances** = 1-3 year commitment, up to 72% discount, best for steady-state
- **Savings Plans** = Flexible commitment to $/hour, works across EC2/Fargate/Lambda
- **Spot Instances** = Up to 90% discount, can be interrupted with 2-minute notice
- **Dedicated Hosts** = Physical server, use for BYOL licenses (per-socket, per-core)
- **Dedicated Instances** = Hardware isolation without full host visibility
- Know that **3-year terms** provide greater savings than 1-year terms
- **All Upfront payment** provides the maximum discount
