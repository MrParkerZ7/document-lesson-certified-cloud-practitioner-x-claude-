## Introduction

Amazon EC2 provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is the backbone of AWS compute services, allowing you to launch virtual servers (instances) with your choice of operating systems, CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

## What is Amazon EC2?

## 🎯 Exam Tips

- **Instance types** start with a letter (family), followed by generation number and size
- **On-Demand** = pay as you go, no commitment, highest flexibility
- **Reserved** = 1-3 year commitment, up to 72% discount
- **Spot** = up to 90% discount, can be interrupted, good for fault-tolerant workloads
- **Dedicated Hosts** = for licensing requirements (per-socket, per-core licenses)
- **Security Groups** = stateful firewall, attached to instances
- **AMI** = template for launching instances (OS + software)
- **EBS** = persistent storage, **Instance Store** = ephemeral storage
- **User Data** = bootstrap scripts run at instance launch

## 🔑 Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Instance | Virtual server in EC2 |
| AMI | Amazon Machine Image, launch template |
| Instance Type | Hardware configuration (CPU, memory, etc.) |
| Security Group | Virtual firewall for instances |
| Key Pair | SSH/RDP authentication mechanism |
| EBS | Elastic Block Store, persistent storage |
| Spot Instance | Discounted unused EC2 capacity |

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. EC2 provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud
2. Instance types are categorized by family (compute, memory, storage, etc.)
3. On-Demand is flexible but most expensive; Reserved and Spot offer savings
4. Spot Instances offer up to 90% discount but can be interrupted
5. Security Groups act as stateful firewalls for instances
6. AMIs are templates containing OS and application configurations
7. Choose the right purchasing option based on workload characteristics
