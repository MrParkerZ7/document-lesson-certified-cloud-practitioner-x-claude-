## Introduction

Amazon Route 53 is AWS's highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS or on-premises, and can also be used to register domain names. The name "Route 53" refers to TCP/UDP port 53, which is used for DNS.

## What is DNS?

## 🎯 Exam Tips

- **Route 53** is a global service (not region-specific) with 100% SLA
- Port 53 is the standard DNS port (hence the name "Route 53")
- **Alias records** are AWS-specific and FREE for AWS resource queries
- Alias records CAN be used at zone apex (naked domain); CNAME cannot
- **Simple routing** returns all values; client chooses randomly
- **Weighted routing** for A/B testing and gradual traffic shifting
- **Latency routing** sends users to lowest latency region
- **Failover routing** for disaster recovery (active-passive)
- **Geolocation routing** routes based on user's geographic location
- **Health checks** enable automatic failover when endpoints fail
- Route 53 can register domains AND manage DNS (two separate features)

## 🔑 Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DNS | Domain Name System, translates names to IPs |
| A Record | Maps domain name to IPv4 address |
| CNAME | Maps domain to another domain name |
| Alias Record | AWS record that maps to AWS resources (free) |
| Hosted Zone | Container for DNS records |
| TTL | Time to Live, how long DNS is cached |
| Health Check | Monitors endpoint availability |
| Zone Apex | Root domain (example.com, not www.example.com) |

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. Route 53 provides DNS, domain registration, and health checking
2. Alias records are free for AWS resources and work at zone apex
3. Use weighted routing for gradual deployments and A/B testing
4. Latency-based routing improves global application performance
5. Failover routing with health checks enables disaster recovery
6. Geolocation routing serves localized content based on user location
7. Route 53 has a 100% availability SLA - highly reliable for DNS
