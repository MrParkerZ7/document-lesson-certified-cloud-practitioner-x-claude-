## Introduction

AWS provides multiple ways to connect your VPCs together, to on-premises networks, and to the internet. Understanding these connectivity options is crucial for designing hybrid architectures and multi-VPC environments. This lesson covers VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, VPN, and Direct Connect.

## VPC Peering

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Purpose | Connect two VPCs privately |
| Traffic | Stays on AWS backbone network |
| Transitive | NOT supported (A-B, B-C does NOT mean A-C) |
| Cross-Region | Supported (inter-region peering) |
| Cross-Account | Supported |
| CIDR | Must not overlap |
| Cost | Data transfer charges only |

## VPC Peering Architecture

|                                                                   |
|   +----------------+                    +----------------+        |
|   |    VPC A       |    Peering         |    VPC B       |        |
|   |  10.0.0.0/16   |<------------------>|  172.16.0.0/16 |        |

|   IMPORTANT: VPC Peering is NOT transitive!                       |
|                                                                   |

|       |                                   ^                       |
|       |     VPC A CANNOT reach VPC C      |                       |
|       +------------- X -------------------+                       |
|                                                                   |
|   Solution: Create direct peering between A and C                 |
|             OR use Transit Gateway                                |
|                                                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## VPC Peering Limitations

## Hybrid Connectivity Patterns

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                 HYBRID CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                   |
|   1. VPN Only (Quick, encrypted, lower bandwidth):                |
|      [On-Prem] ====VPN over Internet===> [AWS VPC]                |
|                                                                   |
|   2. Direct Connect Only (High bandwidth, consistent):            |
|      [On-Prem] ===Direct Connect=======> [AWS VPC]                |
|                                                                   |
|   3. Direct Connect + VPN Backup (Best of both):                  |
|      [On-Prem] ===Direct Connect=======> [AWS VPC]                |
|                 ===VPN (backup)========> [AWS VPC]                |
|                                                                   |
|   4. VPN over Direct Connect (Encrypted DC):                      |
|      [On-Prem] ===DC + IPsec encryption=> [AWS VPC]               |
|                                                                   |

## AWS Client VPN

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Purpose | Remote user VPN access |
| Type | OpenVPN-based |
| Use Case | Work-from-home, mobile access |
| Authentication | AD, SAML, certificates |
| Endpoint | Managed by AWS |

## 🎯 Exam Tips

- **VPC Peering** is NOT transitive - each VPC pair needs its own connection
- **Transit Gateway** enables transitive routing (hub-and-spoke model)
- **VPC Peering** is cheaper but complex with many VPCs; **Transit Gateway** simplifies
- **Site-to-Site VPN** goes over the internet but is encrypted (IPsec)
- **Direct Connect** is a private dedicated connection (does NOT use internet)
- Direct Connect takes weeks/months to set up; VPN is ready in minutes
- **Direct Connect** provides consistent latency; VPN latency varies
- Use **VPN as backup** for Direct Connect for high availability
- **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** is the AWS-side VPN endpoint
- **Customer Gateway (CGW)** represents your on-premises router in AWS
- Direct Connect is NOT encrypted by default - add VPN for encryption

## 🔑 Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| VPC Peering | Private connection between two VPCs |
| Transit Gateway | Central hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises |
| Site-to-Site VPN | Encrypted IPsec tunnel over the internet |
| Direct Connect | Dedicated private connection to AWS |
| Virtual Private Gateway | AWS-side VPN/Direct Connect endpoint |
| Customer Gateway | Represents on-premises router in AWS |
| IPsec | Protocol for encrypting VPN traffic |

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. VPC Peering connects two VPCs directly but is not transitive
2. Transit Gateway simplifies connectivity for multiple VPCs (hub-and-spoke)
3. Site-to-Site VPN provides encrypted connectivity over the public internet
4. Direct Connect offers dedicated private connectivity with consistent performance
5. VPN sets up in minutes; Direct Connect takes weeks to months
6. Use VPN as a backup for Direct Connect for high availability
7. Choose connectivity based on bandwidth, latency, and setup time requirements
