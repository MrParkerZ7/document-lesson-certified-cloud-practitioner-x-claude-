## Overview

Understanding the true cost comparison between on-premises infrastructure and AWS cloud is essential for making informed decisions. This comparison goes beyond just hardware costs to include the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**.

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

TCO includes all direct and indirect costs associated with owning and operating IT infrastructure over its lifetime.

## On-Premises Costs

### Direct Costs
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Hardware** | Servers, storage arrays, network switches, routers |
| **Software** | OS licenses, database licenses, middleware |
| **Networking** | Circuits, bandwidth, load balancers |

### Indirect Costs
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Facilities** | Data center space, power, cooling, physical security |
| **Personnel** | System admins, network engineers, DBAs, security staff |
| **Operations** | Monitoring, maintenance, patches, upgrades |
| **Risk** | Disaster recovery site, business continuity planning |

### Hidden Costs Often Overlooked
- **Over-provisioning** - Buying more capacity than needed
- **Refresh cycles** - Hardware replacement every 3-5 years
- **Technical debt** - Maintaining legacy systems
- **Opportunity cost** - Time spent on infrastructure vs. innovation

## AWS Cloud Costs

### What You Pay For
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Compute** | EC2 instances, Lambda functions |
| **Storage** | S3, EBS, EFS |
| **Network** | Data transfer, VPN, Direct Connect |
| **Services** | RDS, DynamoDB, CloudWatch |

### What's Included (No Extra Cost)
- Physical infrastructure
- Power and cooling
- Physical security
- Hardware maintenance
- Facility management
- Many compliance certifications

## AWS Pricing Calculator

AWS provides a free **AWS Pricing Calculator** to estimate costs:
- Estimate monthly costs
- Compare on-premises vs AWS
- Model different configurations
- Export and share estimates

**URL**: calculator.aws

## AWS TCO Calculator Considerations

When comparing TCO, consider:
1. **Current infrastructure costs** - All categories above
2. **Growth projections** - Will you need more capacity?
3. **Utilization rates** - Are current servers fully used?
4. **Refresh cycles** - When is hardware replacement due?
5. **Staff reallocation** - Can IT staff focus on value-add work?

## Real-World TCO Factors

| Factor | On-Premises | AWS |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **Upfront costs** | High (CapEx) | Low (OpEx) |
| **Scalability** | Slow, expensive | Fast, easy |
| **Maintenance** | Your responsibility | AWS manages |
| **Utilization** | Often 10-30% | Scale to demand |
| **Time to market** | Weeks/months | Minutes |
| **Global reach** | Build data centers | Deploy instantly |

## 🎯 Exam Tips

- **TCO** includes more than just hardware costs
- AWS typically reduces TCO by **30-50%**
- On-premises has many **hidden costs**
- Use **AWS Pricing Calculator** for estimates
- Cloud shifts costs from **CapEx to OpEx**
- Consider **staff reallocation** benefits

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **TCO analysis** must include all costs, not just hardware
2. On-premises has many **hidden and indirect costs**
3. AWS includes infrastructure, facilities, and maintenance
4. Cloud typically shows significant **TCO reduction**
5. Use **AWS Pricing Calculator** for accurate estimates
6. Consider **agility and opportunity cost** benefits
