## Introduction

AWS provides comprehensive backup and disaster recovery solutions to protect your data and ensure business continuity. AWS Backup offers centralized, policy-driven backup management, while various replication and DR strategies help organizations meet their recovery objectives. Understanding these services is essential for the AWS CCP exam.

|                                                                   |
|   RPO (Recovery Point Objective)                                  |
|   = Maximum acceptable data loss (time)                           |
|                                                                   |
|   RTO (Recovery Time Objective)                                   |
|   = Maximum acceptable downtime                                   |
|                                                                   |

|          |    (Data Loss)      |    (Downtime)    |               |
|                                                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## RPO and RTO

| Term | Definition | Question It Answers |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| RPO | Recovery Point Objective | How much data can we afford to lose? |
| RTO | Recovery Time Objective | How long can we be down? |

| RPO Example | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| RPO = 1 hour | Backups every hour, max 1 hour of data loss |
| RPO = 24 hours | Daily backups, max 1 day of data loss |
| RPO = 0 | No data loss acceptable (continuous replication) |

| RTO Example | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| RTO = 4 hours | System must be restored within 4 hours |
| RTO = 24 hours | Can tolerate 1 day of downtime |
| RTO = minutes | Near-zero downtime required |

## AWS Backup Vault Lock

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Purpose | WORM compliance for backups |
| Immutability | Backups cannot be deleted |
| Compliance | SEC, FINRA, other regulations |
| Governance Mode | Soft lock, admin can remove |
| Compliance Mode | Hard lock, cannot be removed |

## Exam Tips

- **RPO** = how much data loss is acceptable (time between backups)
- **RTO** = how long recovery can take (downtime tolerance)
- **AWS Backup** = centralized backup for EC2, RDS, EBS, EFS, DynamoDB, S3
- **Backup & Restore** = lowest cost, highest RTO
- **Pilot Light** = core components running, quick scale-up
- **Warm Standby** = scaled-down functional copy
- **Active-Active** = full deployment in multiple regions, highest cost
- **S3 CRR** = cross-region replication requires versioning
- **Vault Lock** = WORM compliance, immutable backups
- **Point-in-Time Recovery** = restore to any second (RDS, DynamoDB)
- Know DR strategy trade-offs between cost and recovery time

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| RPO | Recovery Point Objective - max acceptable data loss |
| RTO | Recovery Time Objective - max acceptable downtime |
| Backup Plan | Policy defining backup schedule and retention |
| Backup Vault | Container for storing backups |
| Cross-Region Replication | Copying data to another AWS region |
| Pilot Light | DR with minimal core components running |
| Warm Standby | DR with scaled-down functional copy |
| Active-Active | Full production running in multiple regions |
| WORM | Write Once Read Many - immutable storage |

## Key Takeaways

1. RPO defines acceptable data loss; RTO defines acceptable downtime
2. AWS Backup provides centralized, policy-driven backup management
3. DR strategies range from Backup & Restore (cheapest) to Active-Active (most resilient)
4. Lower RTO/RPO requirements increase cost and complexity
5. Cross-region replication enables DR and compliance requirements
6. Backup Vault Lock provides WORM compliance for regulatory needs
7. Point-in-Time Recovery enables granular restore for databases
8. Choose DR strategy based on business requirements for cost vs. recovery time
