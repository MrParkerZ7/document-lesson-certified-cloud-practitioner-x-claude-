## Introduction

Amazon EBS provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. Block storage is essential for databases, file systems, and applications requiring low-latency access to data. Understanding EBS volume types and their use cases is crucial for the AWS CCP exam.

## EBS Multi-Attach

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Volume Types | io1 and io2 only |
| Attachment | Same volume to multiple EC2 instances |
| Constraint | All instances must be in same AZ |
| Use Case | Clustered applications, high availability |

## EBS Encryption

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Method | AES-256 encryption |
| Key Management | AWS KMS (default or custom CMK) |
| At Rest | Data encrypted on volume |
| In Transit | Data encrypted between EC2 and EBS |
| Snapshots | Encrypted volumes produce encrypted snapshots |

## Exam Tips

- **gp3** = recommended general purpose SSD (independent IOPS/throughput)
- **gp2** = legacy general purpose SSD (IOPS scales with size)
- **io1/io2** = highest performance, provision IOPS, for databases
- **st1** = throughput optimized HDD, big data, sequential reads
- **sc1** = cold HDD, lowest cost, infrequent access
- **HDD volumes (st1, sc1)** = cannot be boot volumes
- **EBS volumes** = AZ-specific, can only attach to instances in same AZ
- **Snapshots** = stored in S3, incremental, cross-region copy supported
- **Instance Store** = highest performance, ephemeral (data lost on stop)
- **Multi-Attach** = io1/io2 volumes can attach to multiple instances
- **Encryption** = uses AWS KMS, encrypts data at rest and in transit

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Block Storage | Storage accessed as fixed-size blocks (like a hard drive) |
| EBS Volume | Network-attached persistent block storage |
| IOPS | Input/Output Operations Per Second |
| Throughput | Data transfer rate (MB/s) |
| Snapshot | Point-in-time incremental backup of a volume |
| Instance Store | Ephemeral storage physically attached to EC2 host |
| Provisioned IOPS | Pre-allocated performance level for consistent I/O |
| Multi-Attach | Ability to attach one volume to multiple instances |

## Key Takeaways

1. EBS provides persistent, network-attached block storage for EC2
2. Volume types range from high-performance SSD (io2) to low-cost HDD (sc1)
3. gp3 is the recommended general purpose SSD with independent IOPS/throughput settings
4. io1/io2 volumes are for databases requiring consistent, high IOPS
5. HDD volumes (st1, sc1) are for throughput-intensive, sequential workloads
6. Snapshots are incremental, stored in S3, and can be copied cross-region
7. Instance Store provides highest performance but data is ephemeral
8. EBS volumes are AZ-specific and typically attach to one instance
