## Introduction

Amazon S3 is AWS's flagship object storage service, designed for unlimited scalability, high durability (99.999999999% - 11 nines), and availability. S3 stores data as objects within buckets and is ideal for storing any amount of data from anywhere on the web. Understanding S3 storage classes and features is essential for the AWS CCP exam.

## What is Object Storage?

|                                                                   |
|   Object = Data + Metadata + Unique Identifier                    |
|                                                                   |

## Exam Tips

- **S3 Standard** = frequently accessed data, highest availability
- **S3 Standard-IA** = infrequent access but needs millisecond retrieval
- **S3 One Zone-IA** = infrequent access, single AZ, lower cost, recreatable data
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** = auto-moves objects, no retrieval fees
- **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** = archive with millisecond access
- **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** = archive, minutes to hours retrieval
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** = lowest cost, 12-48 hour retrieval
- **Versioning** = protect against accidental deletion/overwrite
- **Lifecycle Policies** = automate transitions and deletions
- **S3 durability** = 99.999999999% (11 nines) for all storage classes
- **Object size limit** = 5 TB max per object
- **Bucket names** = globally unique across all AWS accounts

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Object Storage | Storage architecture for unstructured data as objects |
| Bucket | Container for S3 objects with globally unique name |
| Storage Class | Different tiers for cost/access optimization |
| Lifecycle Policy | Rules to automatically transition or expire objects |
| Versioning | Keeping multiple versions of objects |
| Durability | Probability that data will not be lost |
| Availability | Percentage of time data is accessible |
| Glacier | Archival storage class for infrequently accessed data |

## Key Takeaways

1. S3 is AWS's unlimited, highly durable object storage service
2. Storage classes range from Standard (frequent access) to Glacier Deep Archive (long-term archive)
3. All storage classes provide 11 nines (99.999999999%) durability
4. Versioning protects against accidental deletion and overwrites
5. Lifecycle policies automate cost optimization by transitioning objects
6. S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves objects between tiers
7. Glacier classes are for archival with varying retrieval times (instant to 48 hours)
8. Cross-Region Replication provides disaster recovery and latency benefits
